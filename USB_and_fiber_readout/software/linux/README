To use this readout software, please read the instructions posted here:

http://code.google.com/p/idlab-general/wiki/USBReadoutSetupInstructions

You might need to run the following to get this to work:
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0

if you run any of the programs directly from the repository version and it says, "file not found", then it means it is linked against a different version of a shared library and you should build the software again (with "make -B")

There are several #defines that are defined in the Makefile (a la -DUSE_USB to enable USB readout mode):

USE_USB
USE_CPCI
USE_FINESSE
FAKE_IT (don't compile in the actual calls to perform the IO operations - useful for testing when no hardware is present)

These are present in the makefile variable COMPILE_FLAGS:

COMPILE_FLAGS = -Isrc/lib -I/usr/include/libusb-1.0 -DUSE_USB -DFAKE_IT
