DESCRIPTION:
You can use any one of these scripts to debug any commands
of the instrument that you are testing over USB
to RS232 connection or Ethernet connection. In order for
you to use these scripts, they must be in the same folder
as link.py and the library of the instrument that
you are using. link.py has the RS232 and Ethernet modules
written to establish communication between the Raspberry
Pi and the instrument so you can send commands to them.
The libraries, such as iseg_SHQ226L.py and keithley_2010.py, 
hold the special string commands that the instruments accept. 

INSTRUMENTS USED:
ISEG SHQ226L High Voltage Power Supply
KEITHLEY 2010 Multimeter

tst_ethernet.py  
tst_iseg.py  
tst_keith.py
