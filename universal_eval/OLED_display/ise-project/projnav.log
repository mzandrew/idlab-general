NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

WARNING:Par:468 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
   Route Static Timing Report"). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go to
   either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or "
   TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
