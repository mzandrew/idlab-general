Using USB interface

1) Attach USB cable before powering on frontend boards
2) Program FPGA (tested on SPARTAN3 with bit file univ_eval_revB_top.bit included in directory)
3) Check that the Cypress USB interface controller is detected:
-use lsusb to get a list of USB devices, should return: Bus ### Device ###: ID 04b4:1004 Cypress Semiconductor Corp.
-if Cypress device is not found try power cycling the board
-if Cypress firmware is not "04b4:1004", check that fw.hex file is present then reprogram firmware: ./load_cypress_firmware
