#summary Description of FPGA firmware in USB_and_fiber_readout subdirectory.

== Introduction ==

The existing firmware in USB_and_fiber_readout is meant to be a basic starting point or template for adding some data acquisition to a board.  The firmware is meant to compile as-is for the SCROD Revision A2, and also be usable on Universal Eval Revisions A and B, with minor modifications that are detailed below.

== Implementation details ==

An overview of the documentation is provided in the following diagram.
